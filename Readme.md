** ETL Data Pipeline on Google Cloud with Cloud Data Fusion & Airflow **

1] Data Generation: Utilized the Faker Library to generate synthetic employee data, including sensitive PII fields, and stored it in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

2] Data Transformation: Leveraged Google Cloud Data Fusion to perform necessary transformations, such as combining two columns and masking sensitive information, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

3] Data Loading: Loaded the transformed data into a BigQuery table, preparing it for in-depth analysis and querying.

4] Data Visualization: Employed Looker Studio to create comprehensive data visualizations and analytics dashboards, offering valuable insights from the processed data.

5] ETL Automation: Automated the entire ETL process using Apache Airflow, orchestrated through Google Cloud Composer, to ensure seamless, scheduled data processing and transformation.
